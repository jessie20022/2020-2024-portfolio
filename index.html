        Hi! I'm Jessica, a sophomore at the University of Maryland. I was born
        and raised in Maryland, but I love to travel and explore new places. I
        also love to learn new things--especially if it's through a hands-on
        activity.
      </p>

        <h3>currently...</h3>
        <p>
          At UMD, I study computer science. I would also love to be involved in
          research for in computer and information science in the future. Along
          the way, I've met some amazing educators who gave me unparalleled
          instruction and opportunities, leading to my decision to double minor
          in mathematics and business analytics. While I love studying these
          three subjects, I also have a interest for neuroscience and psychology
          that I developed in high school.
        </p>
        <p>
          This summer, I will be transitioning from the computer science world
          to the business world with Inspire where I will be working as a
          marketing intern on a breast cancer campaign.

        <h3>previously...</h3>
        <p>
          This past spring semester, I've been working as an intern at Exerceo
          in a professional mentorship program while using Linux and text
          editors on Fedora in Java and JavaScript in order to create an
          inventory that can store items.
        </p>
        <p>
          In high school, I participated in FIRST robotics where I helped with
          the design and building of our robot as well as conduct team bonding
          exercises to help improve everyone's communication.

        <h3>for fun...</h3>
        <p>
          Beyond my academic interests, I love to spent my time playing tennis,
          piano, and a few games such as Valorant or Minecraft. With friends, I
          love to go to new places, whether it be educational or for fun, to
          create memories and take pictures (scroll down!). For personal
          improvement, I like to write in my journal, improve my Chinese, and
          sometimes run.
