      <p>Hi! I'm Jessica, and I was born and raised in Maryland.</p>
      <p>ADD STUFF ABOUT ME</p>

      <section>
        <h3>currently...</h3>
        <p>
          I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the
          University of Maryland. Along the way, I've met some amazing educators
          who gave me amazing instruction and opportunities, leading to my
          decision to double minor in mathematics and business analytics: two
          subjects I'm also interested in.
        </p>
        <p>
          This summer, I will be transitioning to the business world with
          Inspire where I will be working as a marketing intern on a breast
          cancer campaign.

        <p>
          This past spring semester, I've been working as an intern at Exerceo
          in a professional mentorship program while using Linux and text
          editors on Fedora in Java and JavaScript in order to create an
          inventory that can store items.
