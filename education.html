        <p style="margin-left: 2.5rem">
          The following section is dedicated to the college courses I've taken
          at UMD! I tend to get false impressions or hear different things from
          other people about these classes, but I want to record and reflect on
          my own experience. It's mostly for personal recollection, sort of like
          a school journal, but feel free to read on! Courses will be listed in
          order by semesters and course name. The number in parenthesis
          represents the number of credits the course is.

            <ul>
              <li>PHYS121: Fundamentals of Phyics I</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: The first part of a two-semester course in
                general physics treating the fields of mechanics, heat, sound,
                electricity, magnetism, optics, and modern physics. Together
                with PHYS122, this generally satisfies the minimum requirement
                of medical and dental schools.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: I took it because I considered going pre-med?
                Which... that idea didn't age quite well haha. Anyhow, it was
                basically Physics 1 so it wasn't too bad. I learned most of the
                material in high school, so the course was basically a review.
                The downcurve stressed me out, but it was okay! Also met and
                befriended one of the best people in that class, and he was my
                lab partner.
              </p>
              <li>HNUH100: Gateway Seminar</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: First-semester orientation and exploration
                seminar required of all UH students.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: We read Weapons of Math Destruction sorta like a
                book club. We also explored ancient text/maps, and it was quite
                interesting. I also became friends with a really cool guy.
              </p>
              <li>
                HNUH248Y: How Do You "Man Up?": Men, Masculinity, and Mental
                Health
              </li>
              <p>
                Course Description: Students in this interdisciplinary course
                will explore multi-layered issues related to privilege and
                oppression through their own life experiences via exposure to
                theory, research, film, memoirs, and current events. Students
                will evaluate and critique common assumptions about the meaning
                and experiences of privilege and oppression using
                Intersectionality theory as a guiding framework. The human
                experience related to various social identities (i.e., race,
                gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, social class,
                religion, age, and ability) will be addressed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: Super fun and interesting with the help of the
                professor. One of the more interesting units was probably
                learning about the stereotypes.
              </p>
              <li>MATH240: Introduction to Linear Algebra</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: Basic concepts of linear algebra: vector
                spaces, applications to line and plane geometry, linear
                equations and matrices, similar matrices, linear
                transformations, eigenvalues, determinants and quadratic forms.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: Really enjoyed the eigenvalue/eigenvector chapter;
                solving those problems were fun. I also liked the beginning
                where we learned matrices. It became difficult when we started
                learning about transformations though :( definitely half-assed
                and need to review that unit.
              </p>
              <li>CMSC131: Object-Oriented Programming I</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: Introduction to programming and computer
                science. Emphasizes understanding and implementation of
                applications using object-oriented techniques. Develops skills
                such as program design and testing as well as implementation of
                programs using a graphical IDE. Programming done in Java.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: One of my more relaxing core classes, since I had
                prior programming experience. The projects were really fun to
                think about too, since they were mostly like logic puzles.

              <li>INAG110: Oral Communication</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: A study of how perception, self-concept, and
                verbal and nonverbal communications affect the communication
                process as it emerges in the workplace. The course provides
                skill training in speech writing, public speaking, group
                communication, interpersonal communication, listening, and
                responding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: I had a lot of fun: I got to do 3/4 presentations on
                topics I was very familiar with. It was stressful having to do
                four presentations in 3 weeks, not to mention taking a midterm
                and final. Since I took the class online, it was a bit less
                nervewrecking presenting over a Zoom than in real life. However,
                I did learn all about Zoom etiquette and how to properly be
                interviewed online.

                Course Description: Fundamental mathematical concepts related to
                computer science, including finite and infinite sets, relations,
                functions, and propositional logic. Introduction to other
                techniques, modeling and solving problems in computer science.
                Introduction to permutations, combinations, graphs, and trees

              <p>
                Reflection: One of my top three classes at UMD as of May 2021.
                As I write this, my final grade hasn't come out. The class was
                definitely a challenge for many including myself, but I loved
                how much I learned and how the class was taught with lectures
                T/TH and weekly homeworks.
              </p>
              <li>HNUH248A: Identity, Places, & Spaces (3)</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: Students in this interdisciplinary course
                will explore multi-layered issues related to privilege and
                oppression through their own life experiences via exposure to
                theory, research, film, memoirs, and current events. Students
                will evaluate and critique common assumptions about the meaning
                and experiences of privilege and oppression using
                Intersectionality theory as a guiding framework. The human
                experience related to various social identities (i.e., race,
                gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, social class,
                religion, age, and ability) will be addressed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: "My eyes have been opened" is the saying I'd use to
                describe what this class has done for me.
              </p>
              <li>MUSC140: Music Fundamentals I (3)</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: Introductory theory course. Notation,
                scales, intervals, triads, rhythm, form and basic aural skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: Music composition is the bane of my existence: one
                of the most difficult aspects of this class and classical music.
                Music theory isn't too bad though.
              </p>
              <li>CMSC132: Object-Oriented Programming II (4)</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: Introduction to use of computers to solve
                problems using software engineering principles. Design, build,
                test, and debug medium -size software systems and learn to use
                relevant tools. Use object-oriented methods to create effective
                and efficient problem solutions. Use and implement application
                programming interfaces (APIs). Programming done in Java.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: Learning all of the data structures was definitely a
                challenge. I think ArrayLists and Hash/Tree sets are my
                favorites, but I've gotta be more familiarized with binary
                search trees. Linked lists aren't bad too, but it's in the same
                boat as binary search trees.
              </p>
              <li>BSCI170: Principles of Molecular & Cellular Biology (3)</li>
              <p>
                Course Description: Basic principles of biology with special
                emphasis on cellular and molecular biology.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: I took bio and bio lab so I could take more
                neuroscience classes in the future, but this class was a great
                first step. Turns out I knew some of the fundamentals from high
                school biology, but I still definitely learned a lot of new
                material such as the details of photosynthesis and cellular
                respiration.
              </p>

                Course Description: Basic laboratory principles of biology with
                special emphasis on cellular and molecular biology.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reflection: Do I think that the expected time spent on this 1
                credit class should be 10 hours per week is absurd? Yes.
                Otherwise, make the class more credits plz :) In all realness,
                the multi-week labs became incredibly difficult whereas the
                first five one-week labs weren't too strenous (in fact they were
                more so busy work in comparison).
