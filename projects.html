        Currently, I am working on two projects. The first one is a game of
        Minesweeper. I've loved playing minesweeper since my father taught me as
        a child. I thought that it would be sweet to have this be one of the
        last coding projects I do while living at home.
      </p>

        Another project I am working on is PyTracker. It is in the beginning
        stages of development, but I have created an entire map for this
        project. I have decided to ask a friend for help on some of the back-end
        work, while I do most of the front-end and some of the back-end work.
        Essentially, PyTracker will help the user track his sleep, reaction
        times, and gather statistics for the data.
